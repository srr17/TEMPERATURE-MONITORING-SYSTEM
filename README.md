## Objective:
The objective of this project is to measure and display real-time temperature and humidity data using a **DHT11 sensor** and an **Arduino UNO**. The data is outputted to the **Serial Monitor**, providing an easy way to observe environmental conditions.

---

## Key Activities:
- **Sensor Integration:** Connecting the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino to capture real-time temperature and humidity.
- **Code Development:** Writing an Arduino sketch to process the data from the sensor and handle errors effectively.
- **Data Output:** Configuring the Serial Monitor for displaying real-time temperature and humidity values.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing error handling to manage sensor failures.
- **Testing and Validation:** Conducting tests to ensure accurate and reliable sensor data.
- **Documentation:** Preparing documentation to guide users through the project setup and usage.

---

## Technologies Used:
- **Arduino UNO:** Microcontroller used for processing the sensor data.
- **DHT11 Sensor:** For capturing temperature and humidity data.
- **DHT Library:** Used to interface the DHT11 sensor with Arduino.
- **Arduino IDE:** For coding and uploading the program.
- **Serial Monitor:** Used for displaying real-time data from the sensor.

---

## Learning Outcomes:
- Hands-on experience with sensor integration and Arduino programming.
- Improved skills in error handling and debugging.
- Understanding how to visualize sensor data in real-time.
- Knowledge of working with environmental data monitoring systems.

---

## Troubleshooting:
- **No Data Displayed:** Ensure the DHT11 sensor is wired correctly and the right pin is selected.
- **Failed Readings:** Check the sensor and its connections for potential issues.
- **Slow Response:** The DHT11 sensor has a delay between readings; ensure the delay in your code is adequate.
